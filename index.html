            who are we
            <li class="aquote">

            what have we done
            <li class="aquote">
                Over the past year, we have been a helping hand in perserving various internet treasures (mainly image/textboards), as well as helping the admins of the various 4chan archives. Some of these treasures include:

                    Shii's Wiki - A major source of inspiration for the Bibliotheca Anonoma, this wiki was unceremoniously deleted by the creator himself (due to personal concerns), but we were able to resurrect it.

            our wiki
            <li class="aquote"> 
                Our wiki was initally created to help research the content on Shii's wiki and document various stories from Wikichan. We have a "Bibanon Wiki 2.0" in the works, and we'll release this publicly when we have moved over enough pages and updated them to the new wiki markup format.
