            who are we
            <li class="aquote">
                The Bibliotheca Anonoma is a research task force working to archive, document, and safeguard internet folklife, which *chan culture falls under.

            what have we done
            <li class="aquote">
                Over the past 2 years, we have been a helping hand in perserving various internet treasures (mainly image/textboards), as well as helping the admins of the various 4chan archives. Some of these treasures include:

            <ul class="aquote">
                <li>
                    Shii's Wiki - A major source of inspiration for the Bibliotheca Anonoma, this wiki was unceremoniously deleted by the creator himself (due to personal concerns), but we were able to resurrect it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Itabashi - Combines the old with the new. Users of the popular new chat software 'Discord' can now chat with Bibanon members on IRC. Oh, the wonders of modern science!

            requests from us to you
            <li class="aquote">
                We're calling upon the 4chan community to help contribute to the preservation of its culture and history.

                    We accept donations of any *chan related content. This includes 4chan folders, saved threads, or anything else you may have, regardless of size. We can take Google Drive files, MEGA folders, or any content from any other hosting solution you may have in mind. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to send whatever you'd like to us. If you'd like to talk in private or just discuss 4chan in general, feel free to come to our IRC channel and someone will be there to help/talk.
                </li> 
                <li>
                    Another way to help is by contributing to the 4chan history page over at: <a href="http://tanasinn.info/wiki/Complete_History_of_4chan">http://tanasinn.info/wiki/Complete_History_of_4chan</a> If any of you would like to update any part of that page, be it by including links to images or pages or just by making new entries, it would be much appreciated.

            our wiki
            <li class="aquote"> 
                Our wiki was initally created to help research the content on Shii's wiki and document various stories from Wikichan. We have a "Bibanon Wiki 2.0" in the works, and we'll release this publicly when we have moved over enough pages and updated them to the new wiki markup format.
